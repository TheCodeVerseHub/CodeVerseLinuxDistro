    // You can refer to workspaces by index. However, keep in mind that
    // niri is a dynamic workspace system, so these commands are kind of
    // "best effort". Trying to refer to a workspace index bigger than
    // the current workspace count will instead refer to the bottommost
    // (empty) workspace.
    //
    // For example, with 2 workspaces + 1 empty, indices 3, 4, 5 and so on
    // will all refer to the 3rd workspace.
