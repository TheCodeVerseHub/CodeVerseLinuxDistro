# CodeVerse Linux Distro

CodeVerse Linux is a **community-driven, Arch-based Linux distribution** developed under the CodeVerse Hub organization.

The goal of this project is to build a **minimal, fast, and developer-focused Linux distro** with first-class support for **Wayland compositors**, especially **Hyprland** and **Niri**.

This is not a personal distro. It is a **collaborative open-source project** where anyone from the community can contribute.

---

## Project Goals

- Arch Linux base (simple, rolling, upstream-focused)
- Wayland-first experience
- Official support for:
  - Hyprland
  - Niri
- Minimal defaults, no bloat
- Developer-friendly setup
- Clean configs and sensible defaults
- Easy to extend and customize
- Fully community maintained

---

## Target Audience

- Linux users interested in Wayland
- Developers who want a clean environment
- Arch users who prefer curated defaults
- Contributors who want real open-source experience

Beginner and advanced users are both welcome.

---

## What This Project Is

- A learning-oriented but serious distro project
- A collaborative effort across multiple domains
- A place to contribute to:
  - Linux internals
  - Shell scripts
  - Package management
  - Wayland configuration
  - Documentation
  - Design and UX decisions

---

## What This Project Is NOT

- A beginner-friendly installer-focused distro (yet)
- A one-person hobby project
- A bloated or themed distro with heavy customization
- A replacement for Arch Linux itself

---

## Planned Components

- Base Arch install scripts
- Wayland compositor profiles
  - Hyprland default profile
  - Niri default profile
- Minimal system services
- Developer tools (optional)
- Documentation and setup guides
- Branding and identity (logo, name usage, visuals)

---
